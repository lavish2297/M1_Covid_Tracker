# COVID TRACKING SYSTEM
Attributes associated with this system are as follows :

  Number of Active cases
  Number of Total cases
  Number of death cases 
  Number of recovered cases
  Vaccination First dose
  Vaccinaton Second dose

### Number of operations are per steps performned :
* Using dynamic memory we have to create a structure for covid dsescription and details. 
* In the form of number, we have to add Southern state names.
* With respect to state number we have to display covid cases.
* Display all type of cases with respect to user.
* If the details are entered, then the system automatically display through the covid status block.
* Create an structure for vaccinated details using dynamic memory, which could lead us to vaccination status
* Display the Covid status according to the state number.
* First dose and second dose count those details are given by user.
* If the details are entered, then the system automatically display through the Vaccinated status block
* if we given an another set of information means it will be automatically added with the preivous count and Update automatically.

## Guidelines
* For structures we have to use DMA (Dynamic Memory Allocation)
* With respect to all functions, appropriate results will be returned.
* Multifile approach & Modular programming structure is to be followed.
* To perform testing, analysis, coverage & compiling, we have to create Makefile.
